# Survey_slides

This repository is used to store Transformer survey slides and update the proposed modular learning slides.

## Transformer_survey.pptx
This is the main survey slides about transformers. It includes a brief introduction of Transformer structure and four topics related to Transformers, including the adaptations of self-attention module, model compression techniques, learning paradigms in Transformers and applications of Transformers in different domains.

Since the references are too many, we omit the citation of these links. While there are three high-quality and high-level works about Transformers which guided this slides:

[A Survey of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04554)

[Pre-trained Models for Natural Language Processing: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08271)

[A Generalization of Transformer Networks to Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09699)
